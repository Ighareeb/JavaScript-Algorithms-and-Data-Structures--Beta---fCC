		<!-- MEAN -->
		<p>
			The <dfn>mean</dfn> of a list of numbers is the average, calculated by
			taking the sum of all numbers and dividing that by the count of numbers.
		</p>
		<p class="bold">Mean: <span id="mean"></span></p>
		<!-- MEDIAN -->
		<p>
			The <dfn>median</dfn> of a list of numbers is the number that appears in
			the middle of the list, when sorted from least to greatest.
		</p>
		<p class="bold">Median: <span id="median"></span></p>
		<!-- MODE -->
		<p>
			The <dfn>mode</dfn> of a list of numbers is the number that appears most
			often in the list.
		</p>
		<p class="bold">Mode: <span id="mode"></span></p>
		<!-- RANGE -->
		<p>
			The <dfn>range</dfn> of a list of numbers is the difference between the

		</p>
		<p class="bold">Range: <span id="range"></span></p>
		<!-- VARIANCE -->
		<p>
			The <dfn>variance</dfn> of a list of numbers measures how far the values
			are from the mean, on average.
		</p>
		<p class="bold">Variance: <span id="variance"></span></p>
		<!-- STANDARD DEVIATION -->
		<p>
			The <dfn>standard deviation</dfn> measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its means and is
			calculated as the squareroot of the variance.
