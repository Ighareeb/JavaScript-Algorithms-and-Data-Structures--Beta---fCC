<!-- Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation of a random variable expected about its mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

const array = value.split(/,\s*/g);
-->returns ARRAY of strings {separating the string at each comma - followed by zero or more spaces \s*}
example
let value = "1, 2, 3,4,5, 6";
console.log(array); // Output: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"]
